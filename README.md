# Digital_Clock
My digital clock project is an electronic project that aims to create a clock that displays the time in digital format (digits, not hands). I created this project using an arduino that acts as a microcontroller, 4 7-segment displays, 4 mosfets to make the displays flash very quickly and 2 buttons to set the time.
